The primary motivation for my career change is rooted in the ability to work and solve complex, stimulating problems. When I was teaching for the past year, I got a lot of gratification from reaching high school students, but I just did not find the work mentally stimulating.

With a degree in environmental science, I feel like my skills in science are better utilized in a technical field.

My desires for change are also rooted in the increased compensation and the increased likelihood of remote or semi-remote work.
